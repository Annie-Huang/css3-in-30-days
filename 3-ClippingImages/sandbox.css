    shape-radius: 50% is the max you should take for a circle, small value will make circle to be smaller. bigger than 50% will round the corner but never entirely on the edge.
    position is x and y position, start from the top left corner.
    (0, 0) is the top left corner, (100% 100%) is the bottom right corner.
    position indicate where we should put this image.
