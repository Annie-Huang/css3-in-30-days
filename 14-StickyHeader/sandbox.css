/* This tutorial is unfortunately, another tutorial that does not work with lite-server. You will have to keep refreshing the html file.
   This html we are going to work on is the student.html
   Navigate there and keep refreshing the page to see effect.

   The markup you need for this tutorial is in this structure:
      <div class="sticky-header">
      </div>
      <div class="sandbox">
      </div>
      <footer>
      </footer>
*/

body.sticky-header-lesson {
    margin-top: 200px; /* this is 20px larger than .sticky-header height so the content does not touch the header straight away */
}

.sticky-header {
    background: rgba(242, 57, 90, 0.9);

    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    height: 180px;
    width: 100%;

    z-index: 99;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}

.sticky-header h1 {
    font-size: 2.8rem;
    line-height: 3.2rem;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.sticky-header h1 small {
    font-size: 2rem;
}
